# 🍽️ FoodBridge – Connecting Surplus Food to NGOs
A service-based full-stack web application designed to reduce food wastage by seamlessly connecting surplus food donors with NGOs.
### 📖 About

FoodBridge is a service-oriented web application developed to address the growing problem of food wastage while supporting NGOs that work toward feeding underprivileged communities. Traditional food donation methods often rely on manual communication, which can be inefficient and lead to delays, resulting in food spoilage.

This project aims to overcome these challenges by providing a centralized digital platform where donors can easily post surplus food details and NGOs can view, request, and collect food in a timely manner. FoodBridge focuses purely on service-based coordination without any monetary transactions, ensuring simplicity, transparency, and social impact.

Role-based access for Donors and NGOs

Easy food donation with quantity and expiry details

Real-time visibility of available food for NGOs

Status tracking for food donation and collection
